# React_Chat

Hi My name is Shwetha Radhakrishnan. This fictitious Chat Engine App is developed for the residents and interns of Seattle Grace Hospital from the popular Netflix show "Grey's Anatomy". The Grey's anatomy cast finds their way through their tough residency program by forming relationships, friendships, and scrubbing in on surgeries together. This app models potential conversations the interns and residents could be chatting about. This app features online status updates, real time response, read reciept functionality, ability to create new chat groups, text/attatchment/image support, and the ability to add new users through chatengine.io
